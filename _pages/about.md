## Bio

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, where my mentor is [Prof. Huan Lei](https://leihuan-mp.github.io/), and also working with [Prof. Andrew Christlieb](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/directory/Profiles/Person/101537), [Prof. Joshua Burby](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Joshua-Burby/) and [Prof. Guosheng Fu](https://sites.nd.edu/gfu/).
I received my Ph.D. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in Summer 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhenli Xu](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/), and I was a visiting scholar at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/) supervised by [Prof. Xiaoping Wang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/wangxiaoping) in 2022.
I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in Summer 2019.
